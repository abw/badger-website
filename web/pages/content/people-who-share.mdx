# PeopleWhoShare

The `PeopleWhoShare` component renders a warning that you're on your own if
you want to use this software.

<Example
  Component={PeopleCode}
  code={PeopleSrc}
  expand
/>

You can add child content if you want to add something extra.

<Example
  Component={People2Code}
  code={People2Src}
  expand
/>

If you think it's a bit too rambly then the `short` property will cull the
second paragraph.  Set `freedom` to `false` if you don't want the last bit.
The `logo` property can also be set to `false` to get rid of that and you
can set a custom `title`.  But at that point you might as well just create
your own custom warning.

<Example
  Component={PeopleShortCode}
  code={PeopleShortSrc}
  expand
/>
