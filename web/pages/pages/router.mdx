# Page Router

The page router automatically generates routes for files in the `pages`
directory.  You can configure it with the <Link to="/configuration/pages"
code="pages"/> configuration option for the <Link
to="/configuration/site-provider" code="SiteProvider"/>.

### File Types

Pages can be JSX files with an extension of `.jsx` or `.tsx`, or MDX files
with an extension of `.mdx`.

### File Routes

The route for a file will be the filename without any file extension.  For
example an `about.jsx` file would have a route of `/about`, or a
`getting-started/installation.mdx` file would have a route of `/getting-started/installation`.

### Index Pages

An index page (`index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `index.mdx`) will have a route
created which does **NOT** include the filename.  For example, an `index.mdx`
file would simply have a corresponding route of `/`.  The same applies for
index files in directories.  For example, a `/getting-started/index.jsx` file
would have a route of `/getting-started/`.

### Section Layouts

A directory can contain a `_layout.jsx` file which defines a shared layout
for all the files under that directory.  It should contain an `<Outlet/>`
component where the page content will be inserted.
