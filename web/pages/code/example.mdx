# `Example`

Many of the examples shown in this documentation are generated using
the `Example` component.

The end goal is to show the source code for an example alongside the
generated output from rendering the component. But this is where things
get fun, inception style. How do we shown an example of using
the `Example` component without actually using the `Example` component?
And if we did, would that cause the `Example` component to render the
`Example` component, which would cause the `Example` component to render the
`Example` component, and so on.

Let's find out!

There are two properties that must be passed to the `Example` component.
The first is the `Component` which should be a React component that can be
imported in the usual way (on line 2 in this example).  The second is the
`code` property which is the source code of the component.  Vite can import
this as text from the component file by adding the `?raw` suffix (on line 3).

Any other properties (e.g. `caption`, `language`, `highlightLines`, etc) are
forwarded onto the <Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component.

<Snippet
  file="code/example.jsx"
  highlightLines="2-3,8-9"
  expand
/>

When this is rendered it displays the source code using the
<Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component along with the output of
the component alongside it (unless you're using a narrow screen in which case
it appears below.)

It looks something like this:

<Example
  Component={Hello}
  code={HelloSrc}
  language="jsx"
  caption="Hello World!"
  highlightLines="5"
/>
