# `Example`

Many of the examples shown in this documentation are generated using
the `Example` component.  This displays the source code for an example
alongside the generated output from rendering the component.

There are two properties that must be passed to the `Example` component.
The first is the `Component` which should be a React component that can be
imported in the usual way (on line 2 in this example).  The second is the
`code` property which is the source code of the component.  Vite can import
this as text from the component file by adding the `?raw` suffix (on line 3).

<Snippet
  file="code/example.jsx"
  highlightLines="2-3,8-9"
  expand
>
  Any other properties (e.g. `caption`, `language`, `highlightLines`, etc) are
  forwarded onto the <Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component which
  renders the source code complete with syntax highlighting.
</Snippet>

Here's how the above example is rendered.

<Example
  Component={Hello}
  code={HelloSrc}
  language="jsx"
  caption="Hello World!"
  highlightLines="5"
/>

<Heading title="Properties"/>

<Section code="html">
  <Snippet
    file="code/example-html.jsx"
    highlightLines="2,7"
    expand
  >
    You can include HTML files as examples but they're handled slightly
    differently.  In this case you only need to load the raw source text and
    then pass it to the `Example` component as the `html` property.
  </Snippet>

  Here's how that's rendered.

  <Example
    html={HelloHTML}
    caption="Hello World!"
  />
</Section>


<Section code="file">
  You can also load examples from a central directory and reference them
  using the `file` property, similar to the way that the <Link
  to="/code/snippet" code="Snippet"/> component works.

  <Snippet
    file="config/examples.jsx"
    highlightLines="1-6,8-14,18-19"
    expand
  >
    To do this you first need to tell the
    <Link to="/configuration/site-provider" code="SiteProvider"/> how to load
    both the `examples` (code components) and the `examplesSrc` (source code
    for those components).  Both of these are done using Vite's
    `import.meta.glob` function.  Add something like this to your main
    `App.jsx`.
  </Snippet>

  <Snippet
    file="config/examplesPrefix.jsx"
    highlightLines="2,9,20"
    expand
  >
    The example above assumes that your example files are located in the
    `./examples` directory relative to the `App.jsx`. If they're located
    somewhere else then you should change the glob pattern that you pass to
    `import.meta.glob` and define the `matchExamplesPrefix` property as a regular
    expression to remove the prefix.
  </Snippet>

  <Snippet
    file="code/example-file.jsx"
    highlightLines="6"
    expand
  >
    You can then display an example using the `file` property to specify the
    location relative to your `./examples` directory.  As with snippets, the
    language for syntax highlighting will be determined from the file extension.
    If you don't have a file extension or it isn't one of the pre-defined
    extensions then you can use the `language` property to set it.
  </Snippet>


  This is how the above example is rendered.

  <Example
    file="hello.jsx"
    caption="Hello World!"
  />

  MDX examples can also be loaded.

  <Example
    file="hello.mdx"
    caption="Hello World!"
  />

  HTML examples can also be loaded.

  <Example
    file="hello.html"
    caption="Hello World!"
  />
</Section>
