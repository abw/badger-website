# `Source`

The `Source` component can be used to render source code with syntax
highlighting.

<Example
  Component={Text}
  code={TextSrc}
/>

## `code`

The `code` property should be set to the source code you want to display.
Vite allows you to import raw text from a file by adding the `?raw` extension
to an import filename. Note that the `_examples` directory is ignored by the
<Link to="/configuration/pages" code="pages"/> router so it's a good place to
put examples.

<Example
  Component={Load}
  code={LoadSrc}
/>

## `language`

The `language`property should be used to define the language for the correct
syntax highlighting to be applied. The supported languages are shown below.

<table className="shaded striped celled">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Language</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    { Object.values(LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS).filter( distinct() ).map(
      language =>
        <tr key={language}>
          <td className="font-mono">{language}</td>
        </tr>
    )}
  </tbody>
</table>

## `children`

If you define any child elements of the component (passed as the `children`
property) then it will be rendered using the <Link to="/content/split"
code="Split"/> component.  If the container is sufficiently wide then the
content will appear to the left of the code block, otherwise it will be
stacked above it.

<Example
  Component={Children}
  code={ChildrenSrc}
/>

Note that in the example above the two blocks will always appear stacked
because they're being displayed inside the smaller "Output" container.
Here's the output again.  If you've viewing on a large screen then try
resizing the browser window to see the stacking in effect.

<Children/>

## `caption`

The `caption` property allows you to add a caption to the source code.

<Example
  Component={Caption}
  code={CaptionSrc}
/>

## `highlightLines`

The `highlightLines` property allows you to highlight one or more lines or
ranges of lines.  A single line is represented by a number, e.g. `3`.  A range
of lines is represented by a hyphenated pair of the start and end lines, e.g.
`6-7`. Multiple lines or lines ranges should be separated by commas,
e.g. `3,6-7`.

<Example
  Component={Highlight}
  code={HighlightSrc}
/>

## `undent`

The `undent` property can be used to remove whitespace from the start of lines,
effectively un-indenting it.  It should be set to the number of spaces you want
to remove from the start of each line.

<Example
  Component={Undent}
  code={UndentSrc}
/>

## `expand`

The default behaviour is to display the first dozen or so lines of code along
with an "Expand" button to allow the user to expand it to view the entire
source code.  Add the `expand` property if you want it expanded by default.

## `raw`

There are some special comment markers that can be added to the source code to
control what is and isn't displayed. The `raw` property can be added to prevent
any of the this pre-processing from being applied.

A `/* START */` or `{/* START */}` comment line can be added to the source to
indicate the start of the code that you want to display.  Anything before this
comment will be ignored.

An `/* END */` or `{/* END */}` comment line can be added to the source to
indicate the end of the code that you want to display.  Anything after this
comment will be ignored.

A line can be prefixed with a `// PRETEND: `&nbsp;comment. The comment will be
removed and the remainder of the line will be displayed as part of the source
code.  This is useful when using the <Link to="/code/example" code="Example"/>
component which displays the source code of a file and renders the output
alongside it.

This is shown in the example below.  To make this example work I have
to import the `Source` component from `@/code/Source.jsx`.  But I don't want
to show that to users because they need to import it from `@abw/badger-website`
instead.

So I add a `/* START */` comment on line 2 so that line 1 isn't displayed.  I
then add a `// PRETEND: `&nbsp;comment to line 4 to show them what I want them to
see.  As far as Javascript/React is concerned, lines 2 and 4 are ignored
because they're commented out. But when the source code is displayed we see
that lines 3 and 4 in the raw source appear to be lines 1 and 2 in the
processed output.
