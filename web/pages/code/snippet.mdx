# Snippets

The `Snippet` component can be used to render snippets of code loaded from
files.  It uses the <Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component to
render the source code.  The only difference is that it automatically handles
the loading of the source from a pre-defined directory of snippet files.

To use the `Snippet` component you must first tell the <Link
to="/configuration/site-provider" code="SiteProvider"/> where to find the
snippet files.  Add something like this to your main `App.jsx`.

<Snippet
  file="config/snippets.jsx"
  highlightLines="1-7,11"
  expand
/>

The example above assumes that your snippet files are located in the
`./snippets` directory relative to the `App.jsx`. If they're located somewhere
else then you should change the glob pattern that you pass to
`import.meta.glob` and define the `matchSnippetsPrefix` property as a regular
expression to remove the prefix.

<Snippet
  file="config/snippetsPrefix.jsx"
  highlightLines="2,12"
  expand
/>

Then you can import the `Snippet` component and add it to a page where you want
to embed one of your snippet files.  The only required property is `file` which
should be the file path relative to your snippets directory.  For example,
specify `foo/bar.html` for the `./snippets/foo/bar.html` file.

Any other properties set on the `Snippet` component will be forwarded to the
<Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component. e.g. `caption`,
`highlightLines`, `undent`, etc.

<Example
  Component={SnippetComp}
  code={SnippetSrc}
/>

## `language`

The file extension will be used to determine the language type so that the
correct syntax highlighting can be applied.  If the file doesn't have a file
extension or the correct language can't be determined correctly from it then
you should add the `language` property to specify it.

The supported languages and their corresponding file extensions are shown below.
