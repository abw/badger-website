# Snippets

The `Snippet` component can be used to render snippets of code loaded from
files.  It uses the <Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component to
render the source code.  The only difference is that it automatically handles
the loading of the source from a pre-defined directory of snippet files.

<Snippet
  file="config/snippets.jsx"
  highlightLines="1-7,11"
  expand
>
  To use the `Snippet` component you must first tell the
  <Link to="/configuration/site-provider" code="SiteProvider"/> where to
  find the snippet files.  Add something like this to your main `App.jsx`.
</Snippet>

<Snippet
  file="config/snippetsPrefix.jsx"
  highlightLines="2,12"
  expand
>
  The example above assumes that your snippet files are located in the
  `./snippets` directory relative to the `App.jsx`. If they're located
  somewhere else then you should change the glob pattern that you pass to
  `import.meta.glob` and define the `matchSnippetsPrefix` property as a
  regular expression to remove the prefix.
</Snippet>

Then you can import the `Snippet` component and add it to a page where you want
to embed one of your snippet files.  The only required property is `file` which
should be the file path relative to your snippets directory.  For example,
specify `foo/bar.html` for the `./snippets/foo/bar.html` file.

Any other properties set on the `Snippet` component will be forwarded to the
<Link to="/code/source" code="Source"/> component. e.g. `caption`,
`highlightLines`, `undent`, etc.

<Example
  Component={SnippetComp}
  code={SnippetSrc}
/>

## Properties

### `language`

The file extension will be used to determine the language type so that the
correct syntax highlighting can be applied.  If the file doesn't have a file
extension or the correct language can't be determined correctly from it then
you should add the `language` property to specify it.

The supported languages and their corresponding file extensions are shown below.

<table className="shaded striped celled">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File Extension</th>
      <th>Language</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    { Object.entries(LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS).map(
      ([ext, language]) =>
        <tr key={ext}>
          <td className="font-mono">.{ext}</td>
          <td className="font-mono">{language}</td>
        </tr>
    )}
  </tbody>
</table>

### `children`

If you define any child elements of the component (passed as the `children`
property) then it will be rendered using the <Link to="/content/split"
code="Split"/> component.  If the container is sufficiently wide then the
content will appear to the left of the code block, otherwise it will be
stacked above it.

<Example
  Component={ChildrenComp}
  code={ChildrenSrc}
/>

Note that in the example above the two blocks will always appear stacked
because they're being displayed inside the smaller "Output" container.
Here's the output again.  If you've viewing on a large screen then try
resizing the browser window to see the stacking in effect.

<ChildrenComp/>

### `output`

If your snippet file is HTML you can add the `output` option to see the
rendered HTML along with the source.

For non-HTML examples you should use the <Link to="/code/example" code="Example"/>
component.

<Example
  Component={OutputComp}
  code={OutputSrc}
/>
