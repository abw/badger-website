# `metadata`

A page can export a `metadata` object.  This will be merged into the `page`
context data which can be accessed via
<Link to="/context/use-site" code="useSite()"/> or
<Link to="/context/site-consumer" code="SiteConsumer()"/>.

In this example it is perhaps a bit of a pointless exercise because the
`metadata` is right there in the file.  The `page.message` could just as easily
be written `metadata.message`.  However, the `page` data is also accessible in
any other components that you might include from a page or are used in the
site layout.

<Example
  Component={MetadataCode}
  code={MetadataSrc}
  highlightLines="4-6"
  expand
/>

<Heading title="Properties"/>

There are some special properties that can be added to the `metadata` which
can be used to configure various layout components.

...but I haven&apos;t documented them yet.

TODO: `prevNext: false` will prevent previous and next links.
This is required when using a section `_layout.jsx` file, but
I want to find a better way to control this.
