# BadgerPowered

The `BadgerPowered` component renders a link to the <BadgerPowerLink/> web
site containing a badger icon and the word "Badger Powered". It's used in the
default site <Link to="/content/footer" code="Footer"/> component

If you're not building a web site that is part of the Badger Power
collective then you probably don't want this.  You can set the
`site.badgerpower` configuration item to `false` to supress it from the
footer.

<Example
  Component={PowerCode}
  code={PowerSrc}
  expand
/>
