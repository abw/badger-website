# Basic setup

<Heading title="Site configuration"/>

<Snippet
  file="config/site.js"
  caption="src/config/site.js"
  expand
>
  Create a configuration file for your site.  In this example we'll assume
  it's in a `config/site.js` file underneath your main `src` source directory.
</Snippet>

<Heading title="Sidebar configuration"/>

<Snippet
  file="config/sidebar.js"
  caption="src/config/sidebar.js"
  expand
>
  Create a configuration file for the sidebar menu.  Here's an example of
  what it might look like. We'll assume it's in the `config/sidebar.js` file.
</Snippet>


<Heading title="Main application"/>

<Snippet
  file="App.jsx"
  caption="src/App.jsx"
  expand
>
  Add something like this to your main application file.  If you created the
  site using <ViteLink/> (which is highly recommended as all the instructions
  here assume that's the case) then it will be something like `src/App.jsx`

  This imports the `site` and `sidebar` configurations from above.  It also
  scans the `pages` directory to find all the main pages in your site.  Routes
  will automatically be added for these pages.

  The `App` component simply renders the `SiteProvider` imported from
  `@abw/badger-website`, passing the `site`, `sidebar` and `pages` as properties.
  There are lots of additional properties you can pass in here.  More on that later.
</Snippet>

<Heading title="Styling"/>

The main `App.jsx` component also imports a stylesheet for the site.  In the
example above this is `./styles/my-website.scss`, but obviously you can call
it what you like and put it wherever you want.

<Snippet
  file="stylesheet.scss"
  caption="src/styles/my-website.scss"
  expand
>
  The stylesheet should look something like this. It should define a
  `$brand-color` SASS variable as one of the color ranges from
  <BadgerCSSLink path="colors/ranges"/>, along with the `$brand-hue` for that color.
  You can use the corresponding hue from the Badger CSS color range or adjust
  it slightly to better match your desired brand color. It then imports all
  the styling components from `badger-website.scss`.
</Snippet>

The above includes all the SCSS files for <BadgerReactUILink/>, which in turn
includes those for <BadgerFormLink/> and <BadgerCSSLink/>.  It also includes
the styles for <ReactNightAndDayLink/> for the light/dark theme switcher.

<Snippet
  file="stylesheet-minimal.scss"
  caption="src/styles/my-website.scss"
  expand
>
  If you're me (hello me!) or you know what you're doing then you might want
  to roll your own stylesheet that includes custom configuration options
  for any of those modules.  In that case you can import the
  `badger-website-addon.scss` file instead.  This only contains the additional
  styles for Badger Website.
</Snippet>

<Heading title="Create a Page"/>


<Snippet
  file="config/index.mdx"
  caption="src/pages/index.mdx"
>
  Create an `index.mdx` page in your `pages` directory.  If you're not using
  MDX (why not?) then it should be an `index.jsx` page instead.
</Snippet>

You should then be able to start up the development server from the command
line by running `pnpm dev` (or the equivalent for whatever package manager
you're using).
