# Basic setup

## Site configuration

Create a configuration file for your site.  In this example we'll assume it's
in a `config/site.js` file underneath your main `src` source directory.

<Snippet
  file="config/site.js"
  caption="src/config/site.js"
/>

## Sidebar configuration

Create a configuration file for the sidebar.  We'll assume it's in the
`config/sidebar.js` file.

<Snippet
  file="config/sidebar.js"
  caption="src/config/sidebar.js"
/>

## Main application

Add the following to your main application file.  If you created the site
using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vite</a>
(which is highly recommended as all the instructions here assume that) then it
will be something like `src/App.jsx`

<Snippet
  file="App.jsx"
  caption="src/App.jsx"
/>

This imports the `site` and `sidebar` configurations from above.  It also
scans the `pages` directory to find all the main pages in your site.  Routes
will automatically be added for these pages.

The `App` component simply renders the `SiteProvider` imported from
`@abw/badger-website`, passing the `site`, `sidebar` and `pages` as properties.
There are lots of additional properties you can pass in here.  More on that later.

## Styling

The main `App.jsx` component also imports a stylesheet for the site.  In the
example above this is `./styles/my-website.scss`, but obviously you can call
it what you like and put it wherever you want.

The stylesheet should look something like this. It should define a
`$brand-color` SASS variable as one of the color ranges from
<a href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-css/colors/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Badger CSS</a>,
along with the `$brand-hue` for that color. You can use the corresponding hue
from the Badger CSS color range or adjust it slightly to better match your
desired brand color. It then imports all the styling components from
`badger-website.scss`.

<Snippet
  file="stylesheet.scss"
  caption="src/styles/my-website.scss"
/>

The above includes all the SCSS files for
<Link href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-react-ui/" targetBlank
text="Badger React UI"/>, which in turn includes those for
<Link href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-form/" targetBlank text="Badger Form"/> and
<Link href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-css/" targetBlank text="Badger CSS"/>.
It also includes the styles for <Link href="https://badgerpower.com/react-night-and-day/"
targetBlank text="React Night and Day"/> for the light/dark theme switcher.

If you're me (hello me!) or you know what you're doing then you might want
to roll your own stylesheet that includes custom configuration options
for any of those modules.  In that case you can import the
`badger-website-addon.scss` file instead.  This only contains the additional
styles for Badger Website.

<Snippet
  file="stylesheet-minimal.scss"
  caption="src/styles/my-website.scss"
/>

## Create a Page

Create an `index.mdx` page in your `pages` directory.

<Snippet
  file="config/index.mdx"
  caption="src/pages/index.mdx"
/>

## Take it for a spin

You should then be able to start up the development server from the command
line by running `pnpm dev` (or the equivalent for whatever package manager
you're using).
