# Installation

## Vite

Badger Website provides a basic framework for building documentation sites
for React component libraries.

<Snippet
  file="create.sh"
  expand
>
It is intended to be added to sites created using <ViteLink/>.
So unless you already have a web site that you want to add it to, the first
step would be to create a new web site using Vite.
</Snippet>

## Add Dependencies

Then add `@abw/badger-website` to your project as a development dependency.
You'll probably also want to add `sass` if you're not already using it.
If you plan to use SVG images then you'll also want to add `vite-plugin-svgr`.
While you're at it, do yourself a favour and add `vite-jsconfig-paths` too.

If you want to use MDX then you should add `@mdx-js/rollup` and `@mdx-js/react`.
If you want to be able to add extra properties to MDX code blocks then you'll
also need `rehype-mdx-code-props`.

<Tabset
  className="mar-t-2"
  tabs={[
    {
      text: 'npm',
      content:
        <Snippet
          file="install/deps-npm.sh"
          expand
        />
    },
    {
      text: 'yarn',
      content:
        <Snippet
          file="install/deps-yarn.sh"
          expand
        />
    },
    {
      text: 'pnpm',
      content:
        <Snippet
          file="install/deps-pnpm.sh"
          expand
        />
    }
  ]}
/>

## Configure Vite Plugins

You'll need to add those extra plugins to your `vite.config.js` file.
Something like this.

<Snippet
  file="vite.config.js"
  caption="vite.config.js"
  expand
/>

## Configure vite-jsconfig-paths

Here's an example of the `jsconfig.json` configuration file you'll need for
`vite-jsconfig-paths`.  Of course you may need to adjust or add lines based
on what you've got going on in your web site.

<Snippet
  file="jsconfig.json"
  caption="jsconfig.json"
  expand
/>
