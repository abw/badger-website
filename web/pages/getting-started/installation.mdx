# Installation

## Vite

Badger Website provides a basic framework for building documentation sites for React component libraries.

It is intended to be added to sites created using
<a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vite</a>.
So unless you already have a web site that you want to add it to, the first
step would be to create a new web site using Vite.

<Snippet
  file="create.sh"
  expand
/>

## Add Dependencies

Then add `@abw/badger-website` to your project as a development dependency.
You'll probably also want to add `sass` if you're not already using it.  If
you want to use MDX then you should add `@mdx-js/rollup`.  If you plan to use
SVG images then you'll also want to add `vite-plugin-svgr`.
While you're at it, do yourself a favour and add `vite-jsconfig-paths` too.

<Snippet
  file="install.sh"
  expand
/>

## Configure Vite Plugins

You'll need to add those extra plugins to your `vite.config.js` file.
Something like this.

<Snippet
  file="vite.config.js"
  caption="vite.config.js"
  expand
/>

## Configure vite-jsconfig-paths

Here's an example of the `jsconfig.json` configuration file you'll need for
`vite-jsconfig-paths`.  Of course you may need to adjust or add lines based
on what you've got going on in your web site.

<Snippet
  file="jsconfig.json"
  caption="jsconfig.json"
  expand
/>
