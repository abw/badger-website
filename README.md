# Badger Website

Badger Website is a framework / template which I use to generate the
documentation websites for various other badger projects.

You're welcome to use it, but please bear in mind that I wrote it for me to
get a particular job done.  It's a work in progress, lacks documentation and
is subject to change without notice.

## Documentation Website

See the website for documentation and examples.

https://abw.github.io/badger-website/
